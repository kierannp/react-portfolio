  aboutParaOne:
    "I am pursuing degrees in Material Science Engineering and Statistics with minors in Computational Modeling and Computer Science. I really like integrating cross-disciplinary skills to make cool stuff.",
  aboutParaTwo:
    "I am a disciplined individual who enjoys setting and working toward goals that challenge me and cultivate the understanding and forethought needed to effect progress.",
  aboutParaThree:
    "While balancing training and research, I also managed to take three graduate engineering and statistics classes, three undergraduate honors math classes, and three honors chemistry and physics classes. I began teaching myself machine learning at the start of my sophomore year of college, and because I found the topic so interesting, I decided to take a graduate course on artificial neural networks.",
